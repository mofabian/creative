\section{Description of the Model}

\section{Implementation}

The implementation of our model brings many features, as well as some added complexity.\newline
A short overview about the core functionality:\newline

\begin{itemize}
\item Problem Generation\newline
According to user-set constants, the playfield is filled with Agents and Cops. These players are generated with alle the required functionality to later perform their actions. Agents, for example, are already equipped with Hardship.
\item Loop through steps\newline
Since the problem is now specified, we can loop one step at a time, until we reach some final state. In each step, there are a few things that must be done:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reset moves\newline
Every Cop and Agent can move exactly once per step, so we must ensure that they can now move properly.
\item Release imprisoned\newline
All the imprisoned Agents have their sentence reduced by one. All Agents with a sentence of zero or less are set free. They are randomly put onto empty fields on the playfield.
\item Move Cops and Agents\newline
Agents scout out the empty fields in their vision, and choose one at random. In case there are no empty fields, they stay put.\newline
Cops scout for active Agents, as well as empty fields. If they spot an Agent, they move to the Agent's field and arrest him. Should no Agent be inside the Cop's vision, they randomly move to an empty field. In case they can'tfind an Agent or an empty field, they stay put.
\item Set status of Agents\newline
With all the Agents and Cops moved, the Agents need to re-evaluate whether they want to be active. Their activeness is set for the next round, as well as for display purposes. Cops as well as empty squares are also saved for display.
\item Display current model\newline
With the saved values from the step above, a graph can be plotted, showing all Agents and Cops, as well as some info about them.
\end{itemize}
\item Display summarizing plots\newline
At the very end, plot some graphs of the most important values during the computation. Current graphs include active Agents, inactive Agents, imprisoned Agents, active Cops, Legitimacy.
\end{itemize}

This core model has been enhanced by many tweaks and options, listed here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Size\newline
The size of the playfield can now be changed.

\item Occupied to Unoccupied Ratio\newline     
This ratio regulates Occupied Spaces vs. Unoccupied Spaces. In the original paper, the author started with a full playfield, but that might not always be desired.

\item Cop to Agent Ratio\newline    
This ratio sets the global amount of Cops vs. Agents. Especially useful when simulating low/heavy police presence with varying playfield size.

\item Jailterm Min/Max\newline          
Minimum and Maximum amout of steps an Agent will spend in jail if arrested.

\item Jail sentence\newline
In the original paper, the jail sentence was chosen uniformly from zero to some maximum. In reality, jail sentences are not chosen uniformly, and so this function can be altered in whatever way desired. It uses the Jailterm Min/Max discussed above.

\item Activism Threshold\newline
The attitude of an agent against the regime is computed by subtracting the net risk of arrest for that agent from his personal grievance. But what attitude is needed for an Agent to actually go active? In the original paper, this was assumed to be zero, but we implemented a variable to model different people and their resistance to regimes.

\item Murder Threshold\newline
In order to model militant uprisings we needed some functionality for Agents to actually kill or at least attack Cops. This murder threshold is the outcome. Normally much higher than the activism threshold, if fulfilled, the Agent will no longer protest but instead go and hunt down Cops.

\item Murder success rate\newline
Depending on the tools available to murdering Agents, they may or may not succeed in killing a cop. This is used to differentiate between countries with easy/difficult access to weapons for civilians.
\item Murder assasin death rate\newline
Sometimes Agents might get killed while trying to kill a Cop. If the Cops are taken by suprise the revolution might go much more smoothly than if all Cops are heavily armed and have orders to kill every attacker.

\item Vision Min/Max

\end{itemize}
